module Y2IscsiClient
  # Class to represent the authentication information for discovery and login operations
  #
  # When performing any of the two mentioned operations, an iSCSI system can be optionally
  # configured to request authentication between controllers (targets) and hosts (initiators) using
  # CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol). There are three options:
  #
  # - No authentication. No usernames or passwords are needed.
  # - CHAP authentication performed by the target. The target authenticates the initiator by sending
  #   it a CHAP challenge. The initiator must know {#username} and {#password}.
  # - Bidirectional CHAP authentication. The target authenticates the initiator as above and then
  #   the initiator authenticates the target by sending it a CHAP challenge. In addition to knowing
  #   the {#username} and {#password} for the first challenge, the initiator must set {#username_in}
  #   and {#password_in} for the second one.
  #
  # In the yast2-iscsi-client source code, authentication is typically represented by one of these
  # two forms:
  #
  # - Just like four separate strings representing the possible usernames and passwords.
  # - Has a hash in which the keys correspond to the names typically used by Open-iscsi in its
  #   configuration files: "authmethod" ("CHAP" or "None"), "username", "username_in",
  #   "password" and "password_in".
  #
  # In both cases, empty strings are used to represent blank values. Leaving the corresponding
  # username/password empty is the main mechanism used to indicate a given authentication direction
  # (by target / by initiator) is not wanted.
  #
  # This class allows to encapsulates that information and the associated logic.
